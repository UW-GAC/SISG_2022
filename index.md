## Course Format

#### Lectures
Course material will be presented through lectures given via Zoom. Slides for lectures are linked in the schedule below, and recordings of the lectures will be posted afterwards.

#### Exercises
Many of the lectures will be followed with hands-on exercises. Students will be split into Zoom breakout rooms where they can work through the exercises together. Afterwards, the instructors will walk through the exercises and lead a discussion.

To run the exercises, log into [NHLBI BioData Catalyst powered by Seven Bridges](https://platform.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov) with your username and password -- we will use this platform for all live demonstrations during the course.

All of the R code and data can also be downloaded from the [github repository](https://github.com/UW-GAC/SISG_2022) from which the site is built and run on your local machine. Download the complete workshop data and exercises: https://github.com/UW-GAC/SISG_2022/archive/master.zip
